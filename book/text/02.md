# Section 2: Engage

## Involving the community

Community members are experts on what is happening in their surrounding area.

{% include definition term="Resources" %}

Communities are not just groups of people that stay in the same area, they are also a group with a common interest. Community members are in the best position to identify and understand the problems and needs of their community. They can bring in different cultures and habits. The more diverse the people you involve; the more ideas, perspectives, and **resources**{:data-term="Resources"} become available to your project.

A few examples to consider to involve:

{% include definition term="Natural Playground" %}

> **Parents and children** can contribute with labour, assist with funding, and help mobilise the community. Children have great ideas and fantasies for their dream **natural playground**{:data-term="Natural Playground"}.
> 
> **Community members** can serve on committees, give and collect information, participate in surveys, participate on task teams, distribute flyers, promote the project and help with some of the planned activities.
> 
> **Social workers** and members of the Department of Social Development can help you understand the developmental and play needs of children.
> 
> **Community-based organisations (CBO’s and NGO’s)** can advise on strategies, help facilitate meetings, share experience and expertise, serve on committees, help implement plans, help you identify service providers and existing projects. For example, organisations or facilities for people with disabilities can give their views on developing playgrounds that  are inclusive and accessible.
> 
> **Businesses** can assist with products and services, serve on planning committees, and can benefit by displaying their marketing material in the playground or at community events.
> 
> **Faith-based organisations and churches** can provide insights into the community, act as mentors, and offer support and volunteers.
> 
> **Schools** can provide spaces for meetings, workshops or events, allow talks at the school, put up posters, and encourage teachers to participate.
> 
> **Local radio and media** can assist in promoting and supporting events by creating awareness and helping you communicate with the public.
> 
> **Clinics** can assist with the input on the health and nutritional needs of children when active.
> 
> **Philanthropists** often there are individuals in a community that are willing to invest in the growth of its members. These individuals can offer ideas and financial assistance.

## How to handle community participation

We are often tempted to go ahead and do the work on a project ourselves because it can be so much faster. Getting everyone to work together takes a little bit more effort at the start, it may even be slower, but the more we involve people in our projects, the better the results and impact will be. The community will have a stake or interest in the playground and each community member will bring their influence, expertise and resources to the table to build something far greater than each could have done on their own. And finally, by including others, they will be empowered to create similar projects.

To increase the level of community participation in your project, work through the four phases below using the goals, messages and tools as a guide for each phase.

| **Goal**           | To give the community helpful information.      | To gather the opinion of the community on the problem and possible solutions.  | To work with the community to make sure that their views are considered and understood.  | To partner with the community to assess the problem and develop solutions.  |
| **Messages** | We will keep you informed.           | We will keep you informed, acknowledge your concerns and give you feedback on decisions. | We will work with you and the results will reflect how your input influenced decisions.  |  We will get advice and community-specific solutions from you and implement them with your help. |

## Facilitating community meetings

### Get the right people

{% include definition term="Stakeholders (Partners)" %}

Before you approach potential **partners**{:data-term="Stakeholders (Partners)"}, make sure that you are clear on exactly what you are doing and what you want them to do. Consider writing your request on a short letter to take with you; it will show potential partners that the project is organised and professional. “Sell” the project to potential partners by helping them understand what the need is in the community, what your plans are, how they will be addressed, and the benefits of partnering. Be specific and clear on what exactly it is you want them to do.

### Preparation for the meeting

-   Invite participants with a letter that includes a summary of your idea, date, time, length, and location of the meeting
-   Select a meeting place and familiarise yourself beforehand.
-   The ideal meeting place is easily accessible, has refreshments, toilet facilities, and enough space to comfortably accommodate all participants
-   Once you have decided on your facilitation methods, check that you have all equipment required such as pens and paper
-   The most important tool is you! See that you are neatly dressed and groomed, use movement wisely, and engage your audience with gestures and facial expressions

### Use facilitation methods that require active participation

-   Activities should be participant‐centred and participatory such as group discussions and exercises
-   Encourage feedback
-   Limit the presentation of information to mini lectures
-   Provide paper and pen for note taking, and exercises
-   Provide participants with the relevant materials to facilitate group discussions

### Brainstorm

A brainstorm is a rapid‐fire, creative thinking tool used to generate ideas. It is based on a session of uncensored thinking where no one criticises each other’s ideas during the process. It is often used when ideas for a novel need to be generated. You can do it with sticky notes or collect all ideas on a flipchart.

### Facilitators role

-   Focus the group on the set agenda
-   Protect group members from personal attack
-   Remain non‐defensive and accept feedback

### During the meeting

-   Arrive early to allow time to set up the room and make last minute preparations
-   Introduce yourself to the group and briefly outline the aim of the meeting and the agenda
-   Follow the agenda and designated time frames to the extent possible
-   Avoid exceeding the amount of time allotted for the meeting
-   Provide clear instructions and time frames for activities
-   Demonstrate your knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject matter
-   Sessions lasting for two or more hours should include a formal break
-   After the meeting, thank participants and summarise key points in a written report

### Icebreakers and energiser

An icebreaker is any activity at the beginning of the meeting that is designed to get people to know each other better, so they can work together more effectively. Energizers are games that are used when you notice the energy levels of the group getting low. They will usually involve physical movement.

### Splitting in small groups

When you want everyone to participate, splitting a big group into smaller groups might be a good idea. Each smaller group either has the same task or different tasks. You will see that you will get a lot done in a short time and it is a good way to discuss values and beliefs or take a vote where necessary.

### Create a supportive environment

-   call group members by name
-   each person’s questions and viewpoints should be heard
-   be courteous and patient, do not ridicule or belittle people
-   be encouraging and affirm effort and progress
-   ensure that participants are comfortable
