# Section 2: Engage

## Involving the community

Community members are experts on what is happening in their surrounding area.



\[Include defintion\]

Communities are not just groups of people that stay in the same area, they are also a group with a common interest. Community members are in the best position to identify and understand the problems and needs of their community. They can bring in different cultures and habits. The more diverse the people you involve; the more ideas, perspectives, and **resources** become available to your project.



AW-community-groups



A few examples to consider to involve:

\[Box\]



\[Include definition\]

**Parents and children** can contribute with labour, assist with funding, and help mobilise the community. Children have great ideas and fantasies for their dream **natural playground**.

**Community members** can serve on committees, give and collect information, participate in surveys, participate on task teams, distribute flyers, promote the project and help with some of the planned activities.

**Social workers** and members of the Department of Social Development can help you understand the developmental and play needs of children.

**Community-based organisations (CBO’s and NGO’s)** can advise on strategies, help facilitate meetings, share experience and expertise, serve on committees, help implement plans, help you identify service providers and existing projects. For example, organisations or facilities for people with disabilities can give their views on developing playgrounds that are inclusive and accessible.

**Businesses** can assist with products and services, serve on planning committees, and can benefit by displaying their marketing material in the playground or at community events.

**Faith-based organisations and churches** can provide insights into the community, act as mentors, and offer support and volunteers.

**Schools** can provide spaces for meetings, workshops or events, allow talks at the school, put up posters, and encourage teachers to participate.

**Local radio and media** can assist in promoting and supporting events by creating awareness and helping you communicate with the public.

**Clinics** can assist with the input on the health and nutritional needs of children when active.

**Philanthropists** often there are individuals in a community that are willing to invest in the growth of its members. These individuals can offer ideas and financial assistance.

## How to handle community participation

We are often tempted to go ahead and do the work on a project ourselves because it can be so much faster. Getting everyone to work together takes a little bit more effort at the start, it may even be slower, but the more we involve people in our projects, the better the results and impact will be. The community will have a stake or interest in the playground and each community member will bring their influence, expertise and resources to the table to build something far greater than each could have done on their own. And finally, by including others, they will be empowered to create similar projects.



To increase the level of community participation in your project, work through the four phases below using the goals, messages and tools as a guide for each phase.

## Facilitating community meetings

### Get the right people

\[Include definition\]

Before you approach potential **partners**, make sure that you are clear on exactly what you are doing and what you want them to do. Consider writing your request on a short letter to take with you; it will show potential partners that the project is organised and professional. “Sell” the project to potential partners by helping them understand what the need is in the community, what your plans are, how they will be addressed, and the benefits of partnering. Be specific and clear on what exactly it is you want them to do.



### Preparation for the meeting

-   Invite participants with a letter that includes a summary of your idea, date, time, length, and location of the meeting

-   Select a meeting place and familiarise yourself beforehand.

-   The ideal meeting place is easily accessible, has refreshments, toilet facilities, and enough space to comfortably accommodate all participants

-   Once you have decided on your facilitation methods, check that you have all equipment required such as pens and paper

-   The most important tool is you! See that you are neatly dressed and groomed, use movement wisely, and engage your audience with gestures and facial expressions

### 

### Use facilitation methods that require active participation

-   Activities should be participant‐centred and participatory such as group discussions and exercises

-   Encourage feedback

-   Limit the presentation of information to mini lectures

-   Provide paper and pen for note taking, and exercises

-   Provide participants with the relevant materials to facilitate group discussions

### 

### Brainstorm

A brainstorm is a rapid‐fire, creative thinking tool used to generate ideas. It is based on a session of uncensored thinking where no one criticises each other’s ideas during the process. It is often used when ideas for a novel need to be generated. You can do it with sticky notes or collect all ideas on a flipchart.



### Facilitators role

-   Focus the group on the set agenda

-   Protect group members from personal attack

-   Remain non‐defensive and accept feedback



### During the meeting

-   Arrive early to allow time to set up the room and make last minute preparations

-   Introduce yourself to the group and briefly outline the aim of the meeting and the agenda

-   Follow the agenda and designated time frames to the extent possible

-   Avoid exceeding the amount of time allotted for the meeting

-   Provide clear instructions and time frames for activities

-   Demonstrate your knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject matter

-   Sessions lasting for two or more hours should include a formal break

-   After the meeting, thank participants and summarise key points in a written report



### Icebreakers and energiser

An icebreaker is any activity at the beginning of the meeting that is designed to get people to know each other better, so they can work together more effectively. Energizers are games that are used when you notice the energy levels of the group getting low. They will usually involve physical movement.



### Splitting in small groups

When you want everyone to participate, splitting a big group into smaller groups might be a good idea. Each smaller group either has the same task or different tasks. You will see that you will get a lot done in a short time and it is a good way to discuss values and beliefs or take a vote where necessary.



### Create a supportive environment

-   call group members by name

-   each person’s questions and viewpoints should be heard

-   be courteous and patient, do not ridicule or belittle people

-   be encouraging and affirm effort and progress

-   ensure that participants are comfortable

# Section 3: Assess

## What is a needs assessment?



\[Include definition\]



A **needs assessment** is a starting point for generating new ideas. It is best to do a needs assessment at the start of a project.

A playground needs assessment will give you information on:

-   What your playground offers at the moment

-   The views of the children that use the playground

-   The views of other community members with experience of children and play

There are many reasons for doing a needs assessment. A few of them are:

-   To collect information about the need (playground)

-   To ensure we do not build a playground or parts of a playground that is not needed or wanted by the community

-   To help you focus on the needs of the children and not on what we, the adults, want to do

-   To uncover things that you might have missed

-   To test assumptions and reduce the risk of doing more harm than good



AW-needs-assessment



\[Tip box\]

The playground needs assessment tool is the perfect starting point to get community members involved. If people are consulted about the problem, they are more likely to contribute to and participate in the solutions.

\[/Box\]



## How to do a needs assessment



\[Include definitions\]

To solve a problem, we first need to understand what the solution is. A playground **needs assessment** gathers information about the “road” we need to take to create the **natural playground** we want for our children.

In short, it is finding out what needs to be done in order to move from where we are to where we want to be. Watch the video to find out how to conduct a needs assessment for your natural playground.



\[Video 5: How to do a needs assessment\]



\[Tip box\]

Tools 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 can be used to help you conduct a needs assessment for your playground.

title: "Section 4: Act"
style: chapter yellow
---

# Section 4: Act

## What is a playground action plan?



\[Include definitions\]



Action plans turn dreams into reality. A playground **action plan** is a tool that shows your community and **partners** that you are serious about getting things done and helps you make sure you don’t overlook something as well as be efficient with **resources**. An action plan can be as detailed as you wish to make it. The level of detail will be determined by what you want to use it for.



\[Include definition\]

A good action plan is:

**Complete** ‐ make sure you include all the activities you need to do to achieve your **objective**

**Clear** ‐ makes it very clear who will do what by when

**Anticipates risks** ‐ make sure that you consider what would limit implementation of the plan and plan strategies to deal with this

**Considers communication** ‐ make sure that you think of everyone that needs to know something about the implementation, what they need to know and how will you get the information to them



A good action plan will answer:

**Why** are we doing this? What is our vision and mission?

**What** are the objectives we want to achieve with these activities?

**How** will the activities be conducted?

**Who** will do the activities?

**When** will the activities be completed?

**What** do you need in terms of human resources and material resources to do the activities?

**What** risks or challenges do we anticipate and what will we do to address them?

**Who** needs to know what about the project?



### The importance of budgeting



\[Include definitions\]



The best way to stick to your **budget** is to have one.

The budget shows the amount of money you plan to raise and spend for the purpose of establishing a **natural playground**. If your **ECD** centre is registered as an NGO or NPO you have the responsibility to be transparent with the money you spend.

#### A budget is needed for planning

Budgeting helps you to plan and monitor how much money is spent. It helps us to think before we buy things, because if we do not stick to the budget, we will not be able to do what we planned.

#### A budget is needed for fundraising

The budget is an important part of the proposal sent to potential donors. It gives a detailed account of what you plan to do with the money or goods received and what results will be achieved.



\[Include definition\]

#### A budget is needed for monitoring

You need **resources** to implement your plans. If you do not spend your resources as planned, it will affect your ability to complete the project.

#### A budget is needed for accuracy

A budget will help you consider all the little things that will require money, such as:

-   Workshop costs: when you invite people to help you think in a workshop, you will have to provide refreshments and lunch if the workshop takes the whole day. Remember that most of us have a sandwich for lunch so don’t waste money by trying to impress people with expensive lunches.

-   Travel and subsistence costs: even if you get materials donated, you may have to go and pick it up. If it is far, you have to plan for refreshment.

-   Materials and assembling: in addition to the actual material to build or make an item, you will need things like screws, sandpaper and cleaning materials to maintain the playground.

-   Labour costs: if you can not find volunteers with the right tools, you may have to hire tools or workmen with the right tools and expertise for building certain aspects of the playground.

> 

## Write a playground action plan

### Vision

Vision is the dream you have for your natural playground. Your vision communicates what you believe the right playground will do for the children that use it. This will make your beliefs about play clear to the staff, children, parents, volunteers, and the wider community. This information was gathered in Tool 1: Partner Finder.



### Objectives

Objectives describes what you want to achieve. It describes how you plan to address the gap between where you are now and where you want to be . Twelve priority objectives were identified in the Visioning Workshop and each of these objectives were formulated as smart objectives in Tool 7: Formulating Objectives.



### Activities

You can use as much detail for the activities as you think is necessary to run your project smoothly. Always remember to identify the following; what do you plan to do and what activities are you planning to do to achieve the objective? Who is responsible for each aspect of the activity and seeing that it is completed within a set time frame? Activities and timelines were identified when the objectives were formulated in Tool 8: Resource Plan.



### Resources

What do you need in terms of human resources and material resources to do the activities? You must identify what you already have, what you still need, and what this will cost. Use Tool 4: Resource Inventory to assign resources to each activity.



### Risks and challenges

We know the reality is that things do not always work out as we plan. If we plan for things that may go wrong, we are prepared to react quickly and take action to avoid or minimise the impact. It is important to identify what risks or challenges are anticipated and if a challenge is encountered, what will you do to address it.

For instance frequent electricity interruptions will make it difficult to do the administration necessary for the project. We can anticipate this challenge by buying generators or laptops that run on batteries, if possible, or identify tasks we could do during electricity interruptions. Risks and challenges and possible solutions were identified in Tool 6: Risk Benefit Assessment.



### Communication planning



\[Include definition\]

We could have the best **action plan** possible but if we do not communicate it clearly, it will just remain a plan on paper. For each activity you need to consider what needs to be communicated about the project to who and in what way.



### Monitoring implementation



\[Include definition\]

Your **monitoring** plan will help you to track that your activities are implemented as planned. Your monitoring plan was formulated in Tool 9: Monitoring Summary.

# Section 5: Monitor and Evaluate

## 

## What is monitoring and evaluation?



\[Include definitions\]

**Monitoring** and **evaluation** is an important part of every initiative and project as it allows you to track the progress of your initial idea and document results and success. It is also called outcome-based measurement.

Outcome-based measurement is a universal approach that strengthens accountability and encourages clarity about what your project is doing and what it is changing. Outcome-based measurements follow a logical chain of events that link resources to activities, activities to products or results, and results to outcomes and impact. Each step of the project process is linked with the next step, as demonstrated in Figure 13.



\[Include definition\]



Monitoring and evaluation cannot be done at the end of a project, it needs to be designed as part of the chain of events when **objectives** are formulated.



AW-monitoring-flow

Figure 13

Caption: Once you have decided that your approach to play needs to change, follow these steps in the creation of your natural playground.



\[Box\]

**Efficiency** determines the extent to which human and material resources are well used. It tells us if the input is worth the output it achieves.



**Effectiveness** assesses the extent to which a project achieves its objective. It tells us if the input is worth the output it achieves.



**Impact** determines whether or not we are making a difference to the problem we are trying to solve. It tells us if the project is producing change.



**Sustainability** estimates the extent to which changes are likely to continue after the project ends. It tells us if the changes are lasting.

\[/Box\]



## How to approach monitoring and evaluation



### Monitoring

#### Are we getting where we want to be?



In [<span class="underline">Section 1](http://01.html#the-importance-of-play), we saw that play is important for early childhood development and that it offers many varied benefits to the child; in the short term but also and especially in the long term. The ultimate goal of our project is that we want to offer a play environment or space where children can develop the skills, habits and attitudes that they will need for the rest of their lives.



\[Include definition\]

Monitoring and evaluating the project helps us to make sure we reach our goal of having a **natural playground**. Good intentions are not enough. We want results that will lead to the achievement of our goal.



Once the children start using the natural playground, it is important to keep monitoring and evaluating on a regular basis to ensure that the playground is a safe and exciting play space. Use Tool 9 as a guide for monitoring the playground and Tool 10 to monitor that the playground stays inline with safety standards. Tool 11 helps to monitor that the playground is maintained so that the performance and safety of the equipment in your playground remains at a high standard.



\[Include definition\]



We want to show that our project has made a real change in children’s lives and that any donations of money or **resources** were not wasted. If there are places that children don’t use or like, we need to adapt and change it to keep on offering play opportunities that address the holistic developmental needs of the children. Tool 12 can be used to evaluate if the opportunities are there that will have a positive impact on children’s development.



### Evaluation

Monitoring is often about facts and figures, things you can count and see. It is relatively easy to do if you work in a systematic, organised manner.



When you evaluate you make judgements. You weigh the facts that you have analysed against a standard. Choose indicators of evaluation by considering your activities and outputs.



The standard that you use to judge or weigh, is determined by a combination of

-   Theory & Research

-   Societal norms (including laws)

-   Practice experience (informed opinion)

-   Your personal beliefs, attitudes and views

See Tool 12 for examples of the types of evaluations you can do.



Evaluation is a little more tricky than monitoring. It helps if you have experience in evaluating projects when you do it. If you do not have a person on your team that is familiar with identifying indicators for evaluating, try to get someone from your community or from a local NGO to assist you. On the upside, evaluations usually happen further apart than monitoring, generally every three to six months and at the end of a project.

## Tool 2: Playground Map



Explore how people experience the playground by mapping the playground and how they use it.



\[Include definition\]



*This tool forms part of your **needs assessment**.*



### When do you use the Playground Map tool?

The playground map tool is great to use when making improvements to an existing playground. It allows you to clearly identify what you want the new playground to offer. People’s perception of the existing playground can provide information that cannot be obtained any other way. It can reveal areas children avoid or use often, areas that are important or areas that can be developed.

The playground map is a cheap and easy tool to use with young or old. The only requirement is that you have a facilitator and someone to take notes. The playground map helps you get perspective on the existing playground, how children use and access resources and where they prefer to be.



### Who can use the Playground Map tool?

-   Groups or teams

-   Workshop facilitators



### How do you use the Playground Map tool?

To use the Playground Map tool you will need a venue that is close to the playground, a diverse group of at least ten to fifteen people, large sheets of blank paper, and coloured markers or crayons. Additionally, it could be useful to have tables and chairs for participants to use while creating their maps (younger participants can use the floor if necessary) and masking tape to stick the completed maps to the wall during the final discussion.

The facilitator should provide their workshop with the required equipment and follow the outlined steps. The exercise should take approximately one hour in total.



## Playground Map



### Step 1: Frame and explain the exercise

Explain the exercise to participants by telling them that we are going to be drawing our playground so that we can better understand what it offers and what it’s problems are. Assure them that this is a fun activity, that there is no right or wrong way to complete the task, and that the groups are made up of many people because we need many different ideas and perspectives. Divide participants into groups of five to six people and give each group a piece of paper and set of markers or crayons. This step should take five minutes.



### Step 2: Establish a starting point

Ask the group as a whole what the centre of the playground is. This is usually the most used or most prominent area. Once the group agrees, ask each smaller group to make a mark in the middle of their paper representing that central point of the playground. Next, ask them to mark the fence or boundary line of the preschool or playground area. This step should take five minutes.



### Step 3: Walk about and draw playground

Once they have completed step 2, participants are to go for a walk about the playground and to continue to draw their map using the following prompts:



-   Draw the main roads going past the school or playground.

-   Draw any water, trees, rocks or paths in the playground.

-   Draw the current playground equipment. Participants can draw simple symbols as long as it is clear what is what.



Once the general map and layout of the playground is established, participants should map out their playground concerns and opportunities using the following prompts:

> 

-   Mark with a blue dot places where there is playground equipment and write the name of the equipment.

-   Mark with a green dot places where there is natural resources and write what they are (tree, plants, or rocks etc).

-   Mark with a black dot places where children play and write which type of play and the approximate age of the children who use each area.

-   Mark with a yellow dot places where nothing seems to be happening.

-   Mark with a pink dot any items that cannot be moved such as building, big trees, taps, or fences.

-   Mark with a red star any areas or aspects of the playground that pose any dangers or concerns and make a note of what you observed.



Once each group has completed their map they should return to the venue to discuss their findings. This step should take fifteen minutes.



### Step 4: Feedback to the group

Ask each group to send a representative to give feedback and talk through their map. If possible, stick each map on the wall so that they are easy for all to see. This step should take fifteen minutes.



### Step 5: Group discussion

Ask the following questions to the group as a whole (and any other questions that might arise). It is important that either the workshop facilitator or a helper takes notes on what is discussed.

-   What is most obviously the same in all of the maps?

-   What is most obviously different in all of the maps?

-   What have you learned about the playground by drawing the map?

 

This final step should take twenty minutes.

## Tool 3: Playground Dreams



Explore what you want to include in a playground by defining opportunities and activities for all types of plays and ability levels.



\[Include definition\]



*This tool forms part of your **needs assessment**.*



### When do you use the Playground Dreams tool?

You should use the Playground Dreams tool at the start of a project to help you define what you want to include in a playground.

A good natural playground offers opportunities for all types of play. Use [<span class="underline">Figure 11](http://01.html#figure-11) as guide on the different types of play to include in your playground. The playground should cater to all the senses (see, hear, touch, smell, and taste) and have activities and opportunities for users of all ages, abilities, and developmental stages.



### Who can use the Playground Dreams tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams

-   Workshop facilitators



### How do you use the Playground Dreams tool?

Work through the tool and come up with as many ideas as possible to complete each block. In each block, write down what activity or opportunity you would like in your playground for that type of play. You can do this exercise on your own or with small teams or groups at a community participation workshop. The more people that work on the worksheet, the more ideas you will have.

Remember that there are no right or wrong answers. Just come up with as many ideas as possible. When you plan, you can decide what to use or not to use. Make sure to include activities and opportunities for children younger than two years and for children with disabilities.

### When do you use the Issue Finder tool?

The Issue Finder tool helps you to plan for the practical implementation of a playground that meets the safety regulations and standards prescribed by your local authorities.

This tool is designed to be used together with your local guidelines and laws that exist to ensure inclusion and safety in the playground. While we want to offer an exciting playground for children, we want to make sure that we have considered the guidelines and laws that will help to reduce the risk of injury to the children who will be playing in it.

Any plan has practical issues that will affect how we implement it. Considering this in advance will prevent us from getting surprised, discouraged or overwhelmed when we start to build our playground.



### Who can use the Issue Finder tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams

-   Workshop facilitators



### How do you use the Issue Finder tool?

Work through the tool and answer each question as best you can. You can do this exercise on your own or with small teams or groups at a community participation workshop. The more people that work on the worksheet, the more ideas you will have.

## Tool 6: Risk Benefit Assessment

\[Include definition\]

Explore the risks and benefits of playing with **loose parts** by weighing the likelihood of dangers against the potential benefits.



\[Include definition\]



*This tool forms part of your **needs assessment**.*



\[Box\]

We should encourage opportunities for children to define and take their own risks, but it is of the utmost important that adults are not negligent and do not allow for unacceptable dangers and injuries.

\[/Box\]



### When do you use the Risk Benefit Assessment tool?

The Risk Benefit Assessment tool helps you to decide if the benefit outweighs the risks when introducing loose parts play.

Childhood is an ongoing process of trial and error with the potential for achievement, but also the certainty of accidents. Children would never learn to walk, climb stairs or ride a bicycle unless they were strongly motivated to take the risk of injury.

Taking risks is how we learn what we are capable of, what we can achieve and how to survive failure. Opportunities for risk in play are very important, if we want our children to develop into brave, confident, competent, and resilient people. When we select loose parts for play, we are offering opportunities for children to create and experience new kinds of risk.



### Who can use the Risks Benefit Assessment tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams

-   Workshop facilitators



### How do you use the Risk Benefit Assessment tool?

Work through the tool and come up with as many ideas as possible to complete each block. For each group of loose parts, write down the potential physical and emotional benefits for the child, the potential risks of injury, and how best to reduce those risks without limiting the benefits. You can do this exercise on your own or with small teams or groups at a community participation workshop. The more people that work on the worksheet, the more information you will have.

\[Tip box\]

When determining the risks for each group, order them according to the likelihood of them happening. Put risks that are likely to happen daily first, followed by risks likely to happen weekly or monthly and lastly put risks that are likely to happen once a year or never. This is useful in determining the risk to benefit ratio. However, remember that some risks are not worth taking even if they aren’t likely to happen.

## Tool 7: Formulating Objectives



Formulate smart objectives by describing exactly what you want to achieve.



### When do you use the Formulating Objectives tool?

Someone once said; “If you don’t know where you are going, how will you know that you got there?”

Well-formulated objectives lead to successful, measurable projects. When you have established what the priority issues are that you want to address in your project, you need to formulate an objective for each one of these priorities.



### Who can use the Formulating Objectives tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams

-   Workshop facilitators



### How do you use the Formulating Objectives tool?

For each objective, answer the prompts to help you identify how exactly to achieve your goals. For multiple objectives you can copy the prompts onto a piece of paper and write down your answers or you can [<span class="underline">download and print out the worksheet](http://aw-formulating-objectives) to fill it in by hand.



\[Tip box\]

#### Goal:

A goal is the big picture, what you are working towards. For us it is to create or update a natural playground.

Dear parent/ guardian/ community member,



### Request for LOOSE PARTS for our new playground



At the Most Fantastic Pre‐School we believe that play is critically important to the development of our children. We would like to empower our children’s creativity! We want our children to a variety of different materials and objects (loose parts) to move, carry, combine, redesign, line‐up, take apart and put back together in multiple ways!

By stocking our new active open play space, located in the centre of our school, with loose parts we want to offer children:

-   daily inspiration

-   endless possibilities

-   a chance to think

-   encouragement to be creative

Why do we believe this is important? With children’s natural curiosity and creativity, using loose parts will support brain development, scientific experimenting, mathematical thinking, risk-taking, and learning by trial and error ‐ skills we want our children to have to be successful for the rest of their lives!

In order to stock up, we need your help to gather all that we need for our ‘loose parts’. If you have anything at home, or anything you can perhaps gather with your children on an outing, we would very much appreciate it. Please see the list below for items we are looking for.

We appreciate your help and thank you for your support

Kind regards,

MS E.C, Diva

Principal Teacher

## Tool 9: Monitoring Summary



\[Include definition\]



Ensure that everything you planned gets done by **monitoring** implementation.



### When do you use the Monitoring Summary tool?



Monitoring is a regular, ongoing activity that provides information you can use to make sure that the implementation of the project is on track. The Monitoring Summary tool helps you summarise your monitoring activities.



### Who can use the Monitoring Summary tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams



### How do you use the Monitoring Summary tool?

Just as cars have indicators to show the direction you are going, projects need indicators to show the direction it is going. Once you know where to look you will see that there are many indicators that you can check. Performance indicators monitor that activities are completed during implementation of the natural playground.



\[Include definition\]

For each **objective** and activity, identify the indicators needed to measure progress, the way that you will check this indicator, how often you will check it and when it should be completed by. Do this by completing the prompts in the tool below.



For multiple objectives you can copy the prompts onto a piece of paper and write down your answers or you can [<span class="underline">download and print out the worksheet](http://aw-monitoring-summary) to fill it in by hand.

## Tool 11: Monitoring Maintenance



\[Include definition\]



Ensure that your natural playground remains safe by **monitoring** maintenance issues.



### When do you use the Monitoring Maintenance tool?

Preventive maintenance is an important part of managing your natural playground. Once your new playground is built, it is important to regularly monitor the state of your equipment.

When you have a maintenance program in place, with consistent checks, you will maintain the performance and safety of the equipment on your playground. Regular, little bits of upkeep helps you to avoid major damage in the future.



### Who can use the Monitoring Maintenance tool?

-   Individuals

-   Groups or teams



### How do you use the Monitoring Maintenance tool?

Use the tool as a guide for monitoring the maintenance needed in your playground. Walk through your playground and take note of the issues listed on the tool. When you find an issue, comment about it in the space provided.

If you prefer you can [<span class="underline">download](http://aw-maintenance-check) and complete a printed version of the tool which can be given to the person that is responsible for maintenance of the playground.



\[Fillable Form\]

## Monitoring Maintenance



Header: **Broken Equipment:** Check for broken equipment such as loose bolts, missing caps, and cracks. Be sure to check for cracks in the plastic. If you do find a broken piece, remove it (or block it from use) until it is fixed or removed.



Header: **Broken glass, trash, and fragments:** Keep your playground clean by disposing of broken glass and other trash, you can prevent cuts and unsanitary conditions.



Header: **Loose anchoring:** Check that all play equipment that is higher than 50cm is anchored or firmly fixed to the ground. If you find equipment that is not anchored, remove it (or block it from use) until it is fixed or removed.



Header: **Insect Damage:** Insects can damage your equipment if it is made of wood. Keep in mind that if you include natural materials in your play area they will require annual upkeep. You should check for rough spots and regularly sand them down to help prevent splinters.



Header: **Animals, rodents, and pests:** Make sure there are no animals, rodents, or pests in hollows and hide‐outs in the playground.



Header: **Problems with surface under play equipment:** Is the surfacing underneath equipment well maintained? For example, does it have at least 300mm depth of loose fill material underneath? Check high‐use areas such as under swings and slides regularly and fill up if necessary. An easy trick is to mark the ideal surfacing depths on the equipment’s “legs”.



Header: **User modifications:** Check if children have tied ropes or other things to parts or equipment or if have they left things out of place.



Header: **Rusted or corroded metals:** Metal becomes weak (and dangerous) where it rusts or corrodes. Check carefully where metals come into contact with the ground. It is also important to check in between each piece of swing chain and connection points on the swing frame.



Header: **Tyres:** Remember tyres are a fire hazard and should be stored safely. Drill holes in tyres to make sure water can not get trapped inside. Make sure the tyres have no metal wires sticking out.

# Facilitator’s Guide

## Notes for Facilitators

These notes were developed to guide facilitators of the Natural Playground Toolkit. To meet the needs of each individual group, facilitators will need to adapt as required.



#### Target Group Workshop



\[Include definition\]



This workshop will be useful to:

-   Volunteers on management committees. Organisations are assumed to have specialists in **ECD** who are able to train using the toolkit.

-   Managers and staff (at least ECD NQF level 4 or 5) of schools.

-   Provincial and district officials, social service professionals that are employed by Schools, ECD’s, NPO’s, DSD, sports & recreation departments and municipality officials.

#### Purpose of the Workshop



\[Include definitions\]

People who attended this workshop and received the materials are able to:

-   Describe the importance of play

-   Discuss strategies to engage communities

-   Implement a playground **needs assessment**

-   Develop a playground **action plan**

-   Track the progress and success of the project

#### Duration

The duration of this workshop is a minimum of twelve hours. It can be presented over two days or session by session on different days if it is more convenient for the group.

#### Selection of Facilitators

The ideal facilitator for this program will have:

-   At least five years of experience in the early childhood development field

-   A demonstrated ability to work effectively with people whose cultures are different from their own, including differences in race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender, socio‐economic status, level of education, age etc.

-   Prior experience as a facilitator and knowledge of outcome‐based training

-   A command of the language of instruction and terminology related to early childhood development

#### Selection of Training Venue

The ideal training venue has:

-   Adequate free parking and easy access to public transport

-   Enough light but also the possibility to make the room dark enough to see powerpoint slides, if the facilitator decides to create and use these in their presentation

-   Air conditioning, fans, heaters or other ways to make the room temperature comfortable

-   A place to prepare and serve tea and refreshments

-   Limited disturbances

-   Good acoustics so that your voice will carry

-   Enough space to comfortably accommodate your group and their movement, including small group discussions

-   Toilet facilities

-   Accessibility for people with disabilities

#### Remember

You have to familiarize yourself with the venue beforehand so that you can:

-   Check for enough electrical outlets for a laptop and data projector if you choose to use these

-   Check that you can set up the room as you require

-   Plan for your position with a table etc

-   Check that there is either a screen or a smooth wall to project against if you plan to use a data projector and check to see that it works so you can make alternate arrangements before the audience arrives if necessary

#### Toolkit Package

-   Facilitators Guide (this section of the toolkit) that guides the facilitator in implementing the workshop

-   Participants toolkit with Information for participants to use during training, this can either be access to the toolkit on an electronic device, or printed copies of relevant sections, or both



### Tips for handling the workshop



Prepare yourself with the necessary material to conduct a workshop.

\[Video 6: Workshop facilitation tips\]



#### The most important tool is you

See that you are neatly dressed and groomed. Use movement wisely and engage your audience with gestures and facial expressions.

 

#### Set up of workshop space

The ideal room setup permits easy viewing of the facilitator and slide projections. The facilitator should be able to move about and engage the audience. It should also facilitate ease of group discussions. Figure 14 gives examples of possible workshop arrangements.



AW-workshop-arrangement

Reference: Figure 14

Caption: Arrangement of workshop space.

 

#### Refreshments

Scheduling enough body and refreshment breaks is vital. Serving refreshments is key as it impacts on the atmosphere and mood of the workshop. Arrange for someone to help you have tea and refreshments ready.



### Tips for adult training

Knowledge of a few basic principles that underlie the learning process can guide facilitators in presenting in a way that optimizes participants learning.

Adults learn because they want to. They know what they need to learn. Adults learn better by doing. This is why we need to actively engage the participants in the learning process. Participant’s involvement has many benefits. It can help to improve retention and generate interest.



\[Video 7: Adult training tips\]



### Training Methods

#### Facilitator’s role

Your role is to serve as the facilitator of the group’s learning. A good facilitator should:

-   Be a neutral servant of the group

-   Focus the group on the given task and overall agenda

-   Suggest methods and procedures for achieving the task

-   Protect group members from personal attack

-   Remain non‐defensive and accept feedback with goodwill

-   Help the group to reach win‐win decisions or consensus



#### Facilitation methods

There are several facilitation methods utilised in this workshop such as a mini lecture which is similar to a lecture, but shorter and actively involves some level of group participation.



#### Multi‐sensory approaches

People process information through different perceptual styles, including auditory and visual. Using a variety of activities to create multi‐sensory experiences can accommodate different learning styles and can help to reinforce skills or knowledge acquired through other senses. Beside your material, enrich the learning experience by offering opportunities for individuals to share relevant knowledge and experiences. Involvement techniques are a must.

Engage the audience with methods like seeking their agreement to a statement, asking for examples or applying your own experience.

#### Group discussion

Group discussions can take a variety of formats. One form is the structured discussion which involves guided interactions among participants. The facilitator sets the direction and tone of the discussion and keeps the group on track.

#### Brainstorming



\[Include definition\]

The facilitator will pose a question or problem to the group and will ask participants to generate as many ideas or responses as possible. The facilitator records each response and at the end discusses the ideas with the group. Brainstorming is an effective method of both generating participant involvement and drawing on the **resources** of the group to enrich the learning experience.

PowerPoint pointers:

If you choose to create powerpoint slides for your workshop, make sure to practice the slides so you know them. Do not turn your back to the audience and read from the screen. It makes you look unprepared. Rather position the screen of your laptop so you can read from it but make consistent eye contact during the presentation.



## Using Advocacy



Advocacy is when someone speaks on behalf of or in support of a vulnerable group and their rights and needs with the aim of gaining support or commitment.

When we advocate for natural playgrounds, we want to ensure that

-   the voice of children is heard on playgrounds and its importance for healthy development

-   the right of children to play is achieved at a nominal cost

-   the play needs of children are considered when developing playgrounds

-   those with influence in government departments create a supportive environment for the implementation of Natural playgrounds at school level

### Advocacy for the Handbook

The goal for using advocacy in the Natural Playgrounds Toolkit is to gain support and commitment from decision makers for the implementation of natural playgrounds.



In the [<span class="underline">Section 1](http://01.html) of the toolkit, you will find information to use when advocating. Depending on the audience, venue and the amount of time available, you will plan your talk to cover the following issues:

-   The importance of play in child development

-   Natural playgrounds as a solution to providing play opportunities to children at a nominal cost



### Qualities of for advocates



\[Include definition\]

Effective advocates can influence policy and **budgets** by using facts and strong relationships to educate government officials and the public on the changes they want to bring to play opportunities for young children.

Effective advocates have

-   **Good communication skills** to argue their side

-   **Analytical skills** to analyse the situation and argument

-   **Good people skills** to make and build connections

-   **Perseverance** to keep on trying until they succeed

-   **Creativity** to find different ways and angles to present their side

-   **Passion** and a firm belief in the cause they are advocating for

## Using participatory workshops



\[Include definition\]

Most of the tools in this toolkit are specifically designed to be used by groups of diverse **partners** and stakeholders.

\[Include definition participatory workshops\]

There are two **workshops** that cover the tools. At the end of each workshop a task team is elected that summarises the information gathered in the workshop.



### Exploration Workshop Guide



\[Include definition\]

Pinpoint **stakeholders** and where to begin in the creation of your natural playground by facilitating the participation of community members.



#### When should you run an Exploration Workshop?

\[Include definition\]

Finding a starting point for your playground **needs assessment** can be daunting. There are so many possible things that could be investigated. This community participation workshop uses the community as experts of their environment to pinpoint issues that can be explored. Certain issues will be explored on the day, others will be identified and then explored by a task team after the workshop.



#### Before the workshop

**Identify facilitators**: You will need an experienced person to facilitate the community participation workshop. In addition you will need a co‐facilitator to take notes of the group discussions and feedback. The facilitators need to prepare by:

-   Reading through all sections of the Natural Playgrounds Toolkit and ensuring they understand the process of creating a natural playground from start to finish.

-   Reading through the necessary tools in the Toolbox and these instructions for this workshop in the facilitator’s guide.



**Identify participants**: Use Tool 1: Partner Finder as a guide to identify as many people as possible to attend the workshop. There should be at least 1 or 2 people per category.

**Identify venue**: Find a venue that is in the community and close to the existing playground you want to update or the site for the new playground.

**Arrange the workshop**: Make necessary arrangements for the workshop such as refreshments, meals, stationery, devices pre-loaded with the Natural Playground Toolkit, arrange for a facilitator and two or three note takers. Remember to check for any dietary requirements of participants and cater to the special needs of people with disabilities.

### Visioning Workshop Guide



Develop a shared vision and goals for a natural playground by facilitating the participation of community members.



#### When should you run a Visioning Workshop?

Once you have had an Exploration Workshop where you have identified stakeholders, problem areas, and services in the community, the next step is to hold a Visioning Workshop for your natural playground.

 

#### Before the workshop

**Identify facilitators**: You will need an experienced person to facilitate the community participation workshop. In addition you will need a co‐facilitator to take notes of the group discussions and feedback. It is best if the same facilitator and co-facilitator who ran the Exploration Workshop also run the Visioning Workshop. The facilitators need to prepare by:

-   Reading through all sections of the Natural Playgrounds Toolkit and ensuring they understand the process of creating a natural playground from start to finish.

-   Reading through the necessary tools in the Toolbox and these instructions for this workshop in the facilitator’s guide.



**Identify participants**: Invite all participants that attended the Exploration Workshop and invite all partners and stakeholders that were identified in Tool 1: Partner Finder in the Exploration Workshop.

**Identify venue**: Find a venue that is in the community and close to the existing playground you want to update or the site for the new playground.

**Arrange the workshop**: Make necessary arrangements for the workshop such as refreshments, meals, stationery, devices pre-loaded with the Natural Playground Toolkit, arrange for a facilitator and two or three note takers. Remember to check for any dietary requirements of participants and cater to the special needs of people with disabilities.



\[Box\]

#### Visioning Workshop Schedule



1.  Welcome and Recap

> 10 minutes
>
> 8:30 a.m.
>
> Introduce yourself and welcome participants. Summarise where we are in the process of building a natural playground and where we want to get to by the end of the day. Ask for comments on the previous workshop session.
>
> 

1.  Develop a common vision

> 30 minutes
>
> 8:40 a.m.
>
> Divide participants into small groups of approximately five people. Each group is to either draw, write, make a poem, do a rap song or commercial or use any other creative means to share their vision for their playground to the group as a whole in sixty seconds.
>
> Each group has ten minutes to prepare, ten minutes to practice and then there is two minutes per group to present feedback.



\[Tip box\]

Your vision communicates what you believe the right playground will do for your children.

Vision statements should be inspiring and uplifting to everyone involved in the project and easy to communicate. The statement should be short enough to fit on a t-shirt.

Here are a few vision statement examples:

-   Inspiring kids to play

-   Make time for play

-   Playground of dreams

-   When kids play, we all win

-   Play - the work of children

1.  Results of Exploration Workshop

> 30 minutes
>
> 9:10 a.m.
>
> Divide participants into five groups:

-   Group 1 get the summary of Tool 2: Playground Map

-   Group 2 get the summary of Tool 3: Playground Dreams

-   Group 3 get the summary of Tool 4: Resource Inventory

> Each group is to discuss the summary for fifteen minutes and then there is two minutes per group to present feedback.



1.  Finding priorities

> 30 minutes
>
> 9:40 a.m.
>
> Before the workshop, write out the summary of Tool 3: Playground Dreams on twelve separate pieces of large paper. Each of the categories, for example Gross Motor Play, is to be written on its own paper with the corresponding suggestions from the Exploration Workshop written underneath.
>
> Participants have to vote for one item in each category by writing their initials next to it. Facilitator is to count the votes, determine a winner in each category, and mark it clearly. If there is a draw, simply revote that one category. Make sure to assure participants that the other ideas are not thrown out, they are simply reserved for a next time.



1.  Tea Break

### Sample Meeting Invitation



WE NEED YOUR HELP!



Saturday, 18 October, 9h00‐11h00

at The Most Fantastic ECD Centre



Dear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The <span class="underline">Most Fantastic Pre‐School is planning an exciting new natural playground. Please join us for an informational meeting to find out how a natural playground can benefit our children. Learn more and come and help us think.

Many of you will still remember playing outside until your parents called you. Today’s children are experiencing a different kind of childhood. Television and mobile phones mean that many children spend as little as thirty minutes in free, outdoor play each day. Research shows that playing outside can improve vision, reduce ADHD symptoms, improve school performance, reduce anxiety, and encourage a love for exercise.

A natural playground provides simple structures and natural materials that inspire imagination! Rocks, sand, hollow logs and water encourage climbing, construction, experimentation and problem‐solving.

The <span class="underline">Most Fantastic Pre‐School values your input on this project, and your support will help us to put a plan into action. The meeting will be hosted by <span class="underline">Ms. E.C Diva at <span class="underline">The Most Fantastic Pre‐School.

Please let us know if you can make it at <span class="underline">555 555 5555.

Yours in playing,

<span class="underline">Ms E.C. Diva

### Sample introduction letter to parents



Dear Parents



We send this letter in case you have missed our last meeting where we discussed the new way of play we are embracing at our school.

We are excited to announce that we are introducing loose parts play in the <span class="underline">Most Fantastic Pre‐School.

Staff will be encouraging children to use their imagination by playing with resources including cardboard boxes, tyres, baskets, old sheets, wooden planks and plastic gutters. These are called ‘loose parts’. They can be used in many different ways, allowing children to make anything from a pirate ship or castle to a road or house.

Loose parts play will happen in and out of class time; it will be a chance for children to play freely with friends, investigate, discover, explore, create, use lots of trial and error to learn

for themselves and learn to make their own judgments about adventurous play and recognising safety limits.

Please ensure your children are dressed for the weather so they can join in properly – they might need a raincoat or sunscreen, sun hats, or a spare set of clothes depending on the weather.

-   Staff and children will be working together to start the loose parts play.

-   Staff will receive additional information on loose parts play.

-   Issues including how to use the resources safely have been investigated.

-   Children will be involved in discussing health and safety issues.

-   All items will be checked initially and on a regular basis for safety.

Parents and carers, would you like to come and see what’s happening? Do you want to understand why we are moving to this type of play? Phone me on <span class="underline">555 555 5555 so we can arrange a time to meet.

Do you have any resources to donate? We will need loose parts to keep things interesting. Currently we are looking for:

-   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

-   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Let us know if you’d like someone to collect donated items.



Yours in playing,

<span class="underline">Ms E.C. Diva

### Sample play policy



<span class="underline">The Most Fantastic Pre-School

recognises:



-   that children have the right to play

-   that play is the work of a child

-   the importance of having enough time and good places to play freely



Playing is one of the most important aspects of a child’s life.

Playing helps children be healthy, well and happy.

Playing is the way that children learn best and it makes them positive about learning later in life.

Most importantly, playing improves children’s ability to develop and grow.



We value the children’s urge and desire to play and therefore aim to provide for a broad range of play opportunities within the school playgrounds before, during and after the school day.

<span class="underline">The Most Fantastic Pre-School recognises:

-   that children will naturally create and/or seek out challenging situations

-   when playing, some children may have accidents, get dirty, wet or upset

-   we recognise that any potential risk of harm to children needs to be balanced with the benefits that free play offers

We will do our best to avoid that children get hurt by providing supervision for the play opportunities that we provide.

<span class="underline">The Most Fantastic Pre-School believes that adults’ attitudes towards, and understanding of, children’s play will have a huge effect on the quality of the play opportunities we offer at school and at home. We will therefore seek out training opportunities and support research among our staff so that they are confident to facilitate children’s freely chosen, self‐directed play. We will do our best to advocate for play with parents when we have meetings.

## Using Coaching



Coaching is done to improve performance and to develop specific skills, in our case this is the development of a natural playground. Coaching usually takes place on a face‐to‐face, one‐to‐one basis and has a very specific planned programme with a short timeframe. For a coaching relationship to work, it must be based on a foundation of mutual respect and willingness to participate.

Coaching is an effective development approach because it:

-   develops competencies, skills and abilities

-   provides corrective feedback to the participant

-   empowers participants to learn and grow

-   helps participants get clarity in their thinking

-   identifies and solves problems

-   makes decisions, implements changes and overcomes obstacles

-   provides flexibility in the learning process

-   helps participants to implement new knowledge and skills into their practice

### Coaching for the Natural Playground workshops

The goals of using coaching sessions as part of the Natural Playground process is to work with the participant to solve implementation problems and to improve the quality of natural playgrounds that are developed at schools and in the community. The ideal situation is that each participant is paired with a coach to reach these goals.

### Skills and qualities for coaches



\[Include definitions\]



Coaches should be:

-   **Good communicators**

    -   **Strong verbal communication skills** ‐ excellent ability to listen, good presentation skills, ability to summarise information, experience of giving feedback. Coaches can recognise changes in mood and body language and adapt as needed.

    -   **Good written communication skills** ‐ ability to write **action plans**, SMART goals and summarise discussions.

-   **Knowledgeable on the relevant coaching topics** (for example, Early Childhood Development, Children’s developmental needs, play, natural playgrounds, **loose parts**, **free play**, design process, grade R curriculum ‐ all the topics and tools covered in the Natural Playground Toolkit).

-   **Experienced in training or coaching sessions** (for example, generating new ideas, encouraging participation, managing disagreements, facilitating a process, guiding participants).

-   **Strong in soft skills** – coaches should be emotionally intelligent, be good with people and able to establish trust and rapport with people. Coaches can build warm, confidence‐inspiring relationships.

-   **Non‐judgmental, respectful, and accepting of other people** – coaches should remain objective and impartial and be understanding and compassionate of the participant and maintain confidentiality.

-   **Coach‐mode** – a coach does not treat participants like children, wanting to solve their problems for them, rather a coach sees the participant as able, responsible, resourceful and capable to choose.

-   **Up to date** ‐ a coach is willing to commit time and energy to learn coaching skills.



Coaches assist participants in developing to their full potential. They help participants grow and develop a skill by analysing their performances, instructing in relevant skills and by providing encouragement.

| Challenge participants to meet their goals | Be afraid to give feedback to participants  |



### Coaching model for the natural playground process

There are many different coaching models in circulation. The one that will work well in the natural playground process is the GROW model that stands for **G**oal, **R**eality, Options, **W**ay forward. It provides a structure for coaching discussions. The model places the responsibility for development on the participant. They must come to the coaching session with goals for discussion.



AW-grow-process

Reference: Figure 15

Caption: The **GROW** model.



The **GROW** model is used as a discussion tool with four stages for *each* coaching session.



<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Stage 1 <strong>G</strong>oal:</th><th>The <strong>participant</strong> brings the issue they want to work on and solve to the session and writes it down. The <strong>coach</strong> uses questioning and listening skills to help the participant to define exactly what they want to achieve.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Stage 2 <strong>R</strong>eality:</td><td>The <strong>coach</strong> uses questioning and listening skills to help the participant define the issues that need to be addressed.

## Using Group Study

Group study is when a small group of people meet regularly to discuss toolkit material. Each group is unique and benefits from the backgrounds and abilities of all of its members. Forming study groups is a strategy to supplement learning. Groups can share unique insights and learn from each other. For group study to be effective, a leader that is more experienced or has a higher level of education is a prerequisite.

#### Benefits of group study

-   **Improve your notes** Comparing notes allows participants to fill in any information or important concepts they may have missed.

-   **Sharing talents** Groups provide participants an opportunity to benefit from the talents and knowledge of the other group members.

-   **Support system** Group is a great way to give and receive motivation and support from fellow students.

-   **It makes learning fun** Studying in a group environment breaks the monotony of spending long hours studying on your own.

### Group study in the Natural Playground process

The goals of using group study in the Natural Playground process is to create an environment where

-   participants can motivate and encourage each other to progress and avoid procrastination

-   participants can bring and discuss questions about the toolkit material

-   participants can ask and discuss practical questions about the implementation of the learning

Group study sessions should include foundation phase teachers with Grade R teachers. The group study can follow the structure of the guided self‐study toolkit outline. Give members time (one week) to work through a section on their own and then discuss that section at the group study session.

### Skills and qualities for group study leaders

The Group study leader should

-   Have a higher qualification or more experience than the rest of the group.

-   Be able to keep the group focused on the agenda and goals for the day.

-   Keep the group study session from becoming a social group. Groups can always socialise at other times.

-   Require that each group member does their share by preparing for the session.

-   Ensure that no one dominate the group. It is important that all members have an equal opportunity to participate.

 

### Forming a group study

Study groups are effective only if they are taken seriously and conducted regularly with a key focus every time.

**How many**: Three to six participants

**Who**: Participants with the same goals such asworking through, understanding and implementing the Natural Playground Toolkit

**Duration**: One to two‐hour sessions

**When**: Try to have the group study in the same place and on the same day at the same time every week. This will help people to remember when to attend

**Where**: Make sure you do it in a location with none or very little distractions and where group members can communicate freely.



### Managing a successful Study Group

**Decide on basic ground rules to keep order and structure** – make rules about participation, cell phone use, respect for each other, keeping to the agenda and so on.

**Create clear goals and objectives for every study session** ‐ knowing what you want to achieve in a study session will help keep the group on target and prevent losing track of time.

**Be prepared** ‐ unprepared participants are a frustration to themselves and every other member that did prepare. Each member should review the material and make notes on insights they had and questions they want to discuss

**Ensure participation** – in this way everyone has an equal opportunity to benefit from the group. A good way is to assign topics to each person to lead the discussion on.

**Be willing to ask for help** – no one knows everything, and that is okay. If there is a disagreement in the group on a topic, commit to get the answers from a senior staff member and get back to the group.

**Stay focused** ‐ before each session, someone should be assigned to lead the session. The leader must ensure the group sets goals, is productive, stays on track and achieves all the goals. Remember to take a break during the study session.



## Using Guided Self-study



Guided self-study handbooks allow independent learning in a structured format delivered entirely online or electronically. Participants are given all the materials needed to complete the process without supervision or attending classes. Guided self‐study fosters a self‐reliant learning experience where participants work through the content provided in the toolkit completely autonomously.

Benefits of Guided self‐study

-   You face fewer distractions when you are on your own; this helps you to get focused and stay focused.

-   Control your study environment. When you study on your own, you can choose the environment that is perfect for you; maybe you like soft background music, a desk and bright lights.

-   Control your study schedule. Some people prefer to work at night, others early in the morning. Some need a break every 30 minutes, others can work for two to three hours at a time. Some want to study every day, others want to study twice a week.

-   Control your study agenda. Studying on your own gives you the freedom to spend more time on a specific topic, even doing more research on it, if you are interested in it or want to understand it better.



### Guided self‐study in the Natural Playground process

The goals of using Guided Self‐Study in the Natural Playground workshops is to

-   Encourage participants to explore topics

-   Assist participants to develop study skills

Participants are required to keep a Study Journal. After each topic, there are self‐reflective questions that need to be answered before they can progress. The answers, in addition to any other notes participants wish to make, are written in the study journal.

In addition, coaching and group study sessions are available to discuss and clarify the topics further.



### Managing to be successful at guided self‐study

Before you start studying, clarify the following for yourself

-   Are you ready to learn?

    -   Do you believe you can do it? If not, consider what you need to do to believe in yourself. What is your mindset? Are you positive? Do you believe you can grow?

    -   Are you organised? Do you have a place and time to learn? Did you inform family members? Do you have access to the internet and a device to go online? Do you have a notebook (study journal) and pens? Did you switch off everything that can distract you?

    -   Are you self‐disciplined? Can you stick to your decisions or do you need to ask someone to hold you accountable?

    -   Can you be honest with yourself? Self reflection and self‐evaluation is part of learning. If you want to improve, research information on how to improve your self‐reflection skills. If you do not stop and pause to consider what you have learned, you do not give your brain a chance to evaluate and integrate the information.

-   Do you have learning goals?

    -   Set timeline goals for each module and the entire process and clearly indicated when you want to complete it. If you are part of a group‐study or have a coach, this may influence your timing.

    -   Set your own goals for what you want to achieve by completing the playground.

-   How do I learn best?

    -   Can you sit quietly and read the material? Do you need to take notes or draw pictures to understand the material? Do you need to find someone to tell them what you learned so that you can remember it? Do you need to go and do what you learned to remember it? You can read up on learning styles if you are unsure how you learn best. When you know your preference, find ways to make it work for you.

-   How do I know that I am learning?

    -   Reflection - after each topic answer these three reflective questions honestly:

> 1. What information surprised you?
>
> 2. What do you know now that you didn’t know before?
>
> 3. What will you do better or differently from now on?
