## Tool 4: Resource Inventory



\[Include definition\]

Explore what **resources** are available by listing resources in different categories.



\[Include definition\]



*This tool forms part of your **needs assessment**.*



### When do you use the Resource Inventory tool?

You should use the Resource Inventory tool at the start of a project to help you define what resources you have available for each different type of play.

Any space will already have resources that can be used, even if it is only the soil in the yard. By listing the resources into categories, you may find that you have a lot of resources for one type of play but nothing for others.



\[Tip box\]

It is a good idea to complete Tool 3 and Tool 4 at the same time to get an idea of what resources you have and what you will need in the future.

### How do you use the Resource Inventory tool?

Work through the tool and come up with as many ideas as possible to complete each block. In each block, write down what resources you already have that can be used to create an activity or opportunity for that type of play. You can do this exercise on your own or with small teams or groups at a community participation workshop. The more people that work on the worksheet, the more information you will have.
