# Toolbox

## Tool 1: Partner Finder

Find out who cares about your community or school by defining who has an interest or investment in it.

**When do you use the Partner Finder tool?**

Communities are not just groups of people that stay in the same area, they can also be groups with a common interest like a school or workplace or people that live elsewhere but have an interest in the area like business owners, organisations or government departments.

Defining your community helps you to decide who should be involved or can contribute to your natural playground Needs Assessment with manpower, resources, perspectives, experience, expertise, and insights.

You can use the Partner Finder at the start of a project to help you define who the stakeholders are in your community.

**Who can use the Partner Finder tool?**

-   Individuals
-   Groups or teams
-   Workshop Facilitators

**How do you use the Partner Finder tool?**

Work individually or as a group to come up with as many names as possible to complete each column. The more people you are that work on the worksheet, the more ideas you will have. Remember that there are no right or wrong answers, just come up with as many ideas as possible. When you plan, you can decide who to use or not to use. The next step after youâ€™ve completed the Partner Finder tool is to appoint someone to get the contact details for each of the people you listed.
