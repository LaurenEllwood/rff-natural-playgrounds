# <span dir="ltr">Introduction</span>

<span dir="ltr">When children play, they are developing skills, habits and attitudes that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Play is so important for the development of a child that it has been identified by the United Nations</span>[^1] <span dir="ltr">as a right of every child.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">The skills required to properly develop self-discipline, motivation, and the ability to collaborate, all start to take root in the first six years of life. Through play, children learn how to cope with frustration, how to keep trying until they get it right, how to share with others, and how to express themselves.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">What is the Natural Playgrounds Toolkit?</span>

<span dir="ltr">In many places children lack stimulating play opportunities. The Natural Playgrounds Toolkit was developed by [<span class="underline">Penreach</span>](https://penreach.co.za/) to raise awareness of the importance of play and to empower communities, grade R teachers and early childhood practitioners by providing them with the skills required to build a playground for young children out of natural resources.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Who is it for?</span>

<span dir="ltr">The Natural Playgrounds Toolkit is a manual designed for you as a grade R teacher, early childhood development practitioner, community development worker, and all other interested stakeholders to study individually or as a group.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">How was it developed?</span>

<span dir="ltr">Penreach, with the support of the [<span class="underline">Roger Federer Foundation</span>](https://www.rogerfedererfoundation.org/en/home/) piloted the natural playgrounds project to establish a cost-effective educational outdoor environment that covers all spheres of a child’s development using natural products that can be sourced locally, within the community or surrounding areas. The Natural Playground Toolkit was developed to make this initiative available to other schools and communities.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">How should it be used?</span>

<span dir="ltr">The toolkit is divided into five sections that represent the different steps within the process of establishing a natural playground. In the toolkit you will find a toolbox of practical tools and samples that will help you consider everything necessary to make a success of your project. The toolkit will guide you through the whole process of establishing a natural playground in collaboration with parents and your local community.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">While you work through the toolkit, you are encouraged to keep a journal or a set of notes that can help you reflect on your journey and also to note down discussion points for your learning group. At first glance, some of the tools may seem to contain similar information. Each tool, however, forms a specific part of the process that enables you to get to the end result. There is no hard and fast rule that you have to use them all, or use them all exactly as they are presented. If you are an experienced community development worker some of the tools may seem so obvious that you could feel tempted to skip them. We do strongly suggest that you consider the pros and cons carefully before discarding a tool. Remember, however, that our goal is to leverage the experience, expertise and resources that community members and stakeholders bring to the table.</span>
