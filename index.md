# The Natural Playground Handbook

When children play, they are developing skills, habits and
attitudes that will stay with them for the rest of their lives: how to cope with frustration, how to keep on trying, how to share, and how to express what they think and imagine.

But many children lack opportunities to play. This handbook helps communities and teachers to create playgrounds from natural resources.
